        The croissant originally came from Austria, where it was known as the “kipferl.”<br>
        It was brought to France by Marie Antoinette, an Austrian princess who married Louis XVI.<br>
        The croissants shape is traditionally thought to represent the Islamic crescent, celebrating the defeat of the Ottoman Turks in the Battle of Vienna in 1683.<br>
        The first written reference to a croissant in France was in 1853 in a dictionary of commercial and industrial terminology.<br>
        The modern, puff pastry version of the croissant was developed in the early 20th century.<br>
        Croissants are made from a leavened variant of puff pastry, where yeast is added to the dough to help it rise.<br>
        The key to the croissants flaky layers is the technique of “lamination,” which involves folding butter into the dough multiple times.<br>
        A traditional croissant recipe requires the dough to be rested and chilled for several hours, sometimes even overnight, between folds.<br>
        The “Viennoiserie” pastry category, to which croissants belong, is a French term meaning “things from Vienna.”<br>
        Croissants were not widely consumed in France outside of Vienna-style bakeries until the 20th century.<br>
